# BOURCIER_Meline_BOIREL_Luc_PreIng2-BTC2
This GitHub contains several files that we made up to respond as best as we could to the project. 
The experience consisted on treating a group of mouses with antibiotics at the beggining of their life, and then observing the impact on the bacterias of the gut microbiota. Another group of mouses was treated with a placebo in order to have a negative control. 
We used some sites (that are mentionned in our codes), lessons and exemples of programs that we made during the "TD" to help ourselves. 

How to use our code : 
  Make sure you insert the right csv filepath where "filepath" is indicated. You should use the most simple filepath as you could to make it simpler to find your file. 
  "#" are comments which indicates how our program works and the logic behind it.

Limits : 
  Our code doesn't have functions.
  Some elements of the graphics (grid, position of the points, colors) are not the same as on the graphics that were given to us.
